def repair_expenditure_stamps():
    """One-time data-integrity repair for a historical ingestion bug.

    Some historical (no longer in-repo) backfill stamped *aggregate*
    expenditure totals onto individual project rows — e.g. every
    "Lighting of public spaces" project in HARDOI received the ₹7.76 Cr
    SUM of all 31 expenditure transactions for that (description,
    constituency) group. Because projects.expenditure feeds the risk
    rules (overspend, disbursement-with-zero-progress), those rows also
    carry fabricated HIGH risk scores.

    A stamp is provable when a project's expenditure exactly equals the
    SUM of expenditure_amount over the conservative match key used by
    timeline/activity (normalized work description + constituency +
    state) — a per-project figure cannot coincidentally equal a multi-
    transaction group total. Groups with several same-named projects
    each received the same group total, which is exactly the duplicated
    ₹7.76 Cr signature.

    Repair: zero those project rows' expenditure. The expenditures table
    (the financial source of truth) is untouched — project-level financial
    activity remains available via the timeline / expenditure-activity
    endpoints, which conservatively match work-level records. Risk scores
    for repaired rows are recomputed afterwards (see main.py startup).

    Not touched:
      - ids 1, 2, 83624, 83625 — manually created test/demo rows
        (POST /projects + recorded test_upload.csv sync), whose values
        were entered directly, not derived from any group aggregate.
      - The 83,625 genuine project identities: repeated work names are
        real (the Vonter source lists many separate works with generic
        descriptions, e.g. 30 identical ₹739,865 lighting works in Sant
        Kabir Nagar), so no project rows are merged or deleted.

    Idempotent: guarded by a sync_metadata marker row.
