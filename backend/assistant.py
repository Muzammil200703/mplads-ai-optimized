"""
MPLADS AI Assistant engine
==========================

A deterministic, role-aware question router — NOT a generative LLM. Every
answer is either:

  1. Static knowledge-base guidance (general MPLADS / website help), or
  2. Composed from REAL database query results (SQL with LIMITs).

Nothing is invented: if no intent matches or data is missing, the assistant
says so. Role enforcement happens here on the server — the same
auth.require_* machinery the rest of the app uses — so a citizen can never
pull audit data regardless of what they type.

Memory discipline (512MB Render): every query is aggregated or LIMIT-ed;
nothing is cached beyond FastAPI's existing bounded cache; no pandas.
