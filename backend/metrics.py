"""
Authoritative financial-aggregation service
===========================================

Single source of truth for every "Total Expenditure" / utilization /
completed-works number in the application.

Why this exists — the data model has THREE independent datasets:

  projects            — recommended-works catalog (sanctioned amounts,
                        status, FY, completion% as recorded by the
                        recommending authority). Its per-project
                        `expenditure` column is a LEGACY field: only 4
                        seed/test rows carry a value, so aggregating it
                        systematically under-reports spend as ~₹0.
  expenditures        — the payment ledger: 106,263 dated transactions,
                        ₹391.87 Cr avg-scale rows, totaling ₹3,918.73 Cr.
                        This is the ONLY authoritative expenditure source.
  completed_works     — the completions ledger: 43,173 works with final
                        amounts and completion dates. This is the ONLY
                        authoritative completed-works source.

The two ledgers are payment/completion records with generic work
descriptions; they do NOT join reliably to individual project rows
(verified: only 62/6,315 distinct ledger keys match any project key).
So portfolio aggregates are computed FROM THE LEDGERS DIRECTLY, and
`fy`-scoped queries attribute ledger rows to financial years by
payment/completion date using the standard Indian FY (Apr–Mar).
The FY values stored on project rows come from the same recommendation
dataset and are used unchanged for project-scoped metrics (counts,
sanctioned).

Per-project / per-state / per-constituency views keep sanctioned and
project counts from `projects` (they are the recommended-work catalog)
and are not rewritten here; anything labeled "expenditure" or
"completed" anywhere in the app must come from this module.

All functions take a SQLAlchemy Session and are SQL-aggregated
(constant memory; nothing is materialized in Python).
